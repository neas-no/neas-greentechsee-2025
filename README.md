# NEAS – GreenTechSee Hackathon 2025

## Project: Norgespris

This project is NEAS’ contribution to the **GreenTechSee 2025 Hackathon**.  
It explores the concept of **Norgespris**, a new state-backed alternative to the current Norwegian energy subsidy scheme.  

With Norgespris, households and holiday homes get a **fixed electricity price of 0.50 NOK/kWh (incl. VAT)** all year round. Customers keep their existing electricity agreement, but gain **predictability and stability** in their bills.  

To support this, NEAS has developed a **customer guide** that helps people compare the traditional subsidy scheme with Norgespris, making it easier to choose what fits their needs best.
